# Jarvis - Virtual Assistant

Jarvis is a virtual assistant designed to perform a variety of tasks like opening websites, playing music, fetching news, and generating AI-based responses using Google Generative AI. The assistant can be triggered using voice commands.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition:** Listens for a wake word ("Jarvis") and then waits for further voice commands.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Provides audio feedback using the `pyttsx3` library.
- **Open Websites:** Opens commonly used websites like Google, Instagram, LinkedIn, GitHub, and YouTube.
- **Play Music:** Can play songs from a predefined music library.
- **Fetch News:** Fetches the latest news headlines using the News API.
- **AI Responses:** Generates AI-based responses using Google's Generative AI API.

## Libraries Used

- `speech_recognition`: To recognize speech input from the user.
- `pyttsx3`: For converting text to speech.
- `webbrowser`: To open web pages in the default browser.
- `requests`: To make HTTP requests to fetch news.
- `google.generativeai`: To interact with Google's Generative AI API.
- `musicLibrary`: A custom module to manage and fetch music links.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. **Pip**: Python package installer is required to install the necessary libraries.
3. **Google Cloud API Key**: Required for using Google's Generative AI API.
4. **News API Key**: Required for fetching news.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-assistant.git
   cd jarvis-assistant
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` file should contain:
   ```plaintext
   SpeechRecognition
   pyttsx3
   requests
   google-generativeai
   ```
   
3. **Configure API Keys:**
   - Replace the placeholder API keys in the code with your own:
     - `NewsAPI` key for fetching news.
     - `Google Generative AI` API key for AI-based responses.

## Usage

1. **Run the Jarvis Assistant:**
   ```bash
   python jarvis.py
   ```

2. **Use Voice Commands:**
   - Start the assistant by saying the wake word, "Jarvis".
   - Give commands such as:
     - "Open Google"
     - "Play [song name]"
     - "What's the news?"

## Customization

- **Add More Commands:** You can add more commands in the `processCommand()` function.
- **Music Library:** You can add more songs to the `musicLibrary` module with their respective links.
